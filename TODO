Create a teacher-student crm
It needs to be TDD - test driven development
All storage should be done on S3
This is for portfolio so it needds to be good
Roles need to be well implemented
The app needs to be well documented
Would be nice to add CI/CD
Has to have a precommit hook for testing and standardazing

Step 1: Authentication
    1. Create a student-student Model DONE
    2. Create User-Role relation DONE
    3. Create Role middleware DONE
    4. Test it DONE
    5. Remove register method DONE
    6. Only Admin can register new users, but a teacher can create Students
    7. Create custom input renderer DONE
    8. Create view for creating new users with the renderer DONE


Stage 2 (A.K.A stuff that was not implemented in stage 1 mostly because of lazyness):
    1. Input rederer should be way more modifiable and written better(select)
    2. Roles have some messy logic

Finishing touches:
    1. All css to should be in one place
    2. App should be publishable
    3. All javascript should be in one place
    4. It should be 100% test covered
    5. Whole code should be reviewed and prettified
