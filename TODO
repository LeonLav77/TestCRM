Create a teacher-student crm
It needs to be TDD - test driven development
All storage should be done on S3
This is for portfolio so it needds to be good
Roles need to be well implemented
The app needs to be well documented
Would be nice to add CI/CD

Step 1: Authentication
    1. Create a student-student Model DONE
    2. Create User-Role relation DONE
    3. Create Role middleware DONE
    4. Test it DONE
    5. Remove register method
    6. Only Admin can register new users
    7. Create custom input renderer
    8. Create view for creating new users with the renderer


Stage 2 (A.K.A stuff that was not implemented in stage 1 mostly because of lazyness):
    1. Input rederer should be way more modifiable and written better(select)


Finishing touches:
    1. All css to should be in one place
    2. App should be publishable
    3. All javascript should be in one place
    4. It should be 100% test covered
